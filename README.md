# Divinitor DN Reference

This is the site for static reference data for Dragon Nest.

Data includes boss stats, enhancement rates and costs, nest information, and other relevant data.

The site can be accessed [here](http://reference.dn.divinitor.com).

The [Driver](https://github.com/vincentzhang96/reference.dn.divinitor.com/tree/driver) branch contains code for the servers that listen for patches and updates the site data accordingly.

The [gh-pages](https://github.com/vincentzhang96/reference.dn.divinitor.com/tree/gh-pages) branch contains the website code.

The master branch doesn't do anything but look pretty and host this readme file.
